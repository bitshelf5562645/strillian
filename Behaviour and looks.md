## Biology and Physique

### Appearance
The Strillian are an anthropomorphic species with body parts similar to those of dragons, boasting not only an extremely versatile and long tail they can use to grab and manipulate objects, but also large wings, bearing resemblances to those of bats.  
Their ears are rather large when compared to other species similar to them.  
They are quite slender, having a pretty slim, but not too slim body for their height.  
They have pitch-black scales, which can change color if and when they want them to, their back is covered in very tiny bright blue and bright pink spots, giving an almost galaxy-like look.  
The Strillian have an average height of 190cm (6'3) with a standard deviation of about ± 32cm (about one foot), but since this is a standard deviation it is still possible for a Strillian to be taller or shorter.

### Mortality
Due to their impressive advancements in the realm of technology, it seems that the Strillian are unable to die of natural causes, as the nanomachines in their system pick up on any potential threats before quickly nutralizing them, unless they chose not to keep their nanomachines, some believe a natural life is a good life and thus choose to have them removed, the lifespan of a Strillian without nanomachines is on average 198 years, with a standard deviation of ± 27 years.  
It is also still completely possible for them to die with nanomachines they are not invincible and can still be victims of events such as murder or accidents.

### Maturing
Even though it would seem like it should take much longer due to the fact that they can grow up to be 198 years, a Strillian has already reached adulthood by the time it is 21.

### Reproduction
Actual explanation soon

### Peculiar qualities
For a reason that is still unknown they can shift around their organs and body parts, for example, they can move their wings to their arms, or move their stomach to somewhere else inside of their body, it is speculated that this once was a necessity for survival when they were still evolving as an intelligent species.  
Another odd quality they have is the fact that their blood isn't red, it is in fact a golden color, fortunately it isn't real gold though.


### Strengths and advantages
- If stuck, a Strillian can contort its body to escape danger or a tight space.  
- A strillian with nanomachines cannot die of natural causes.  

### Weaknessess and shortcomings
- It costs a large amount of energy for them to actually contort their bodies.
- A Strillian **can** still die due to accidents or wounds.

## Behaviour
The Strillian are a very curious species and have been observed to show an almost uncanny interest in other lifeforms, trying to understand anything that is sentient and can be communicated with.
They seem to take great pleasure in discovering new species and planets, hopping from planet to planet just trying to discover who else is out there in space.  

### Their relationship with humanity
At first humanity was not exactly comfortable with the idea of a new species moving to the earth, but this quickly changed as it became clear that the Strillian were mostly passing through out of curiosity.  
Some Strillian chose to stay, as they had made friends with some humans and were more than happy to be of help to them.  
However humanity still had a bit of a nagging fear about what would happen to them if it were to ever go wrong, if the Strillian had come to the earth with so little effort, who was to say that they couldn't destroy it?  

### Communication
On the topic of communication, due to their relation to nanotechnology, the Strillian don’t necessarily need to communicate normally, instead, they can communicate among themselves using their implants, however, they prefer making small computer-like beeping noises as a way of telling other Strillian “hey, we’re talking”.  
This also comes in handy when trying to start a bond with organisms that are not Strillian, if they listen to a small amount of an organism’s language or speech, the implants will put together an understanding of the language, allowing them to speak said language.  
They have been documented to completely have learned human speech, due to their curious nature they quickly started to learn English, after which most Strillian were satisfied, however, a group of Strillian set out to learn every human language.

### Emotions 
They have trouble with feeling the following emotions: embarrassment, anger, and disgust, however, they can be learned to experience these emotions.  
However, for an unknown reason, they can still naturally experience sadness without having to learn this.  
In addition to this, the scales on their hands represent how they’re currently feeling.  
But if it is an emotion that they have learned, then it will show on their wings instead, and in the event that they learned every single emotion, a small orange spot in the form of a flame will show up on their chest.  
Due to their insensitivity to the aforementioned feelings, the Strillian have managed to live in peace ever since they came into existence, however this does not mean that they do not know how to stand up for themselves, they are insensitive to negative emotions, not impervious.  
So if provoked enough, a Strillian will pick a fight and will not back down until they either win or lose.  
A Strillian starts off with only its standard range of emotions, it is not required for them to learn the "unknown" emotions for them to live a fulfilling life, however, due to their curious nature, at least a third of them tend to eventually gain these emotions during their life as they interact with organisms from a species unlike theirs.  
By observing how other organisms react they can draw connections between emotions, if they for example experience certain events the same way.  
But it also allows them to learn new emotions, for example, if a Strillian is friends with a human, and the Strillian makes a mistake, causing the human to be angry, then the Strillian will learn from this interaction. After observing certain emotions enough they will gain an understanding of how it works and eventually begin experiencing it themselves as well.

Most Strillian are perfectly fine with their emotions being visible to everyone, but some are not as comfortable with the idea, in which case some choose to cover their hands with large gloves.

## The Nanomachines

### Keeping them or not
Young Strillian were given two choices the day they turned eighteen (MAYBE CHANGE AGE), they could choose to keep the nanomachines they had been given after birth, or they could choose for them to be removed. Due to the machines' useful nature most choose to keep them, but some Strillian believe it is better to live a natural life.  

### Functions
The machines normally reside inside of their bodies, but due to the machines' small size, they can come out at any time and cover any body part where a Strillian might need protection, the host however needs to make them do this, they cannot do it on their own, when the machines are covering a part of a Strillian's body, they can also use an array of modules, such as a small heating panel, speakers, small displays, and more.  
Something the machines **will** do on their own is try to patch up any wounds, this will not help a lot however, since it will only cover the wound temporarily.   
They can also clump together and form extra limbs for the Strillian to use, but this temporarily disables their ability to protect any body parts.  

### Battery
The nanomachines do not have a battery that lasts forever, when the machines were new, their creators wanted to make central wireless charging centers on Seraph, but they quickly realized this was not a good choice as they realized the next step they would take as a species would be long-ranged space travel.
So to fix this, in the second version, they chose to implement new features for charging and preventing battery drain.
1. To prevent the battery from draining very quickly, they chose to add a way for the machines to charge slightly due to body temperature, this is not a permanent measure though.
2. In the event that their battery runs too low, they will clump together and form a UV-panel, encouraging their host to go take a walk. 

These are the only two measures that are in the most recent version, but they're still trying to think of an emergency measure or something more efficient to this day.  

### Self Destruction
In the event that it is absolutely necessary, the nanomachines can be tasked by their owner to tear their host apart.  
But they can also be tasked to destroy themselves.  
This is locked behind multiple identification methods, so if a Strillian asks for any of the two, the nanobots will first go through the following steps.
1. Firstly, they will try to identify if their host was actually serious, or if they were joking, if they were serious then step two will execute.
2. The nanobots will task their host with saying three short sentences and check if the Strillian's voice matches the one it should be, if it matches their host's voice then the final step will be executed.
3. Finally some of the machines will identify if it is truly their host through DNA, taking a few very small blood samples. If the samples match their host's, then they will go through with the request.

## Their society
The society the Strillian live in could be described as a mix between capitalism and communism.  
Strillian are provided with a base amount of every month, this sum of money is enough to get them through the month, but they can choose to do some work on the side, which will get them more money to do what they want.
