## FAQ

### Can I use my character for NSFW content?
Yep, go nuts!

### Is my character allowed to already know the normally “unknown” emotions?
Yep, that’s quite alright, but try to make sure learning said emotions is part of their backstory, a Strillian cannot simply learn these emotions in the blink of an eye, they slowly learn to handle and experience these emotions the older they get and the more they interact with other species.

### It seems that the Strillian are very social creatures, is it possible for one to be less social or shy?
Yes, it is possible but pretty rare for a Strillian to be introverted, but the majority of them are social.

### What if my Strillian is introverted but I want them to learn the normally "unknown" emotions?
They don't necessarily have to communicate with others a lot to learn these emotions, just like humans, they are not perfect creatures and can still make mistakes, things that can lead to a negative reaction from others. There are still events that could lead them to learn about how these feelings work.
